# eCommerce Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing eCommerce sales data to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product dynamics. The analysis is divided into three levels of complexity:

- **Basic Queries**: Focus on fundamental aspects such as customer locations, order counts, sales by category, and payment methods.
- **Intermediate Queries**: Dive deeper into monthly order trends, average products per order, revenue contributions by category, price correlations, and seller performance.
- **Advanced Queries**: Provide advanced analytics including moving averages, cumulative sales, growth rates, customer retention, and top-spending customers.

The goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights that can help improve sales strategies, enhance customer understanding, and optimize product and seller performance.
